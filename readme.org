* TODO Files' Description


  - train/train.py -- deprecated
    1) Takes in the input video and or path and runs the openpose
       engine to get the JSONs and the annotated images.

  - pipeline.sh
    - An alternate script to generate annotations and pose data using
      openpose from a video.

  - single_image.sh
    - Script does the same as pipeline.sh but for a single image.
    
  - pipeline.py -- DON'T USE
  - videoWriter.py -- DON'T USE

  - hough_lines_out.m
    - Function calculates Hough lines for the pavement.

  - proc_image.m
    - Called by python script to get the Hough lines

  - transformers.py
    - Has video transform function (a higher order function that takes
      transforms and applies them on a frame-by-frame basis)

  - get_roi_video.py
    - Uses transformers to the get the region of interest.  
      + transform == identity (no transform)
      + transform == hough (Uses Hough line to remove the road.)
      + Interfaces with matlab via matlab.engine for the Hough transform.


  - gen_data.sh
    + This is used for annotating images once we have the JSON stating
      the Pose for every frame

  - train/poseClassifier.py
    - Does the actual pose classification.  It performs one-class SVM
      training and classification as well as the fuzzy logic on the
      images. 

  - train/svmClassifier.py  -- Deprecated
